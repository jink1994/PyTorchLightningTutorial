# PyTorchLightningTutorial
The torch lightning has data and model completely detached. It's intuitive and also very useful in AI research, where you need to test a lot models at the same time. <br>

I'm building a series of lightning templates as I get to know more about the APIs. <br>

The ultimate goal of this repository is to help entry-level ML practitioners learn from use cases that I did before. <br>
